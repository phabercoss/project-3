  <h3>10. Fire Emblem Awakening</h3>
  <img src="media/fireEmblemAwakening.jpg" alt="Strategical RPG">
  <p>Starting off this list, Fire Emblem Awakening takes the spot at number 10.
   I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up the game, but as soon as
   I played it I was hooked. I loved the strategy RPG elements of this game, and
   I also loved the friendship and romance mechanics that were intertwined with
   the gameplay giving the characters fun interactions. This game also made
   me get the other Fire Emblem games which is why it's number ten on my list.</p>
  <h3>9. Fallout 3</h3>
  <img src="media/fallout3.jpg" alt="Dystopian Wasteland Shooter RPG">
  <p>This game is definitely a favorite of mine that I didn't expect. I am not
  usually a huge fan of post apocalyptic games, but I definitely enjoyed this game
  for the quests, characters, and how the setting was handled.</p>
  <h3>8. Persona 4 Golden</h3>
  <img src="media/persona4Golden.jpg" alt = "Colorful JRPG">
  <p>This game is great to me because I also love the characters and how this games
  is both a simulation and a role playing game as well. There is a lot to do within
  the game.</p>
  <h3>7. Sims 3</h3>
  <img src="media/sims3.jpg" alt="Open Sandbox Simulator">
  <p>I love this game mainly for all the memories I have of playing it during high
  school when I had way too much free time on my hands. It definitely is a very open
  sandbox game with a lot of things to customize like your sim characters, house, town, etc.
  I'd definitely recommend this game if you like simulation games because this is definitely
  a classic simulation game in my opinion.</p>
  <h3>6. Dragon Age Origins</h3>
  <img src="media/dragonAgeOrigins.jpg" alt="Fantasy RPG">
  <p>This game is a game I definitely need to play more since I just started playing
   a few months ago, but so far it definitely has become one of my favorite games!
   I love the game for the many choices you can make, I love the story so far, and
   there are different characters with different backgrounds to choose from to start
   your story from. I'd definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a large
   fantasy role playing game with mature themes. </p>
  <h3>5. Stardew Valley</h3>
  <img src="media/stardewValley.jpeg" alt="Farming Simulator">
  <p>One of my guilty pleasure games that I have loved since high school have been
  farming simulator games where you farm, raise animals, and interact with people
  within a small town with charming personalities. This is exactly what you do
  in Stardew Valley. I admit it sounds boring at first, but Stardew Valley is definitely
  a fun game with a lot of fun things to find and explore and a lot of fun things to discover
  while farming. The art style is definitely one of my favorites on this list, and
  creator of the game definitely put a lot of time and thought into creating this relaxing game.
  I'd definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a casual de-stressing video game.</p>
  <h3>4. Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes</h3>
  <img src="media/sengokuBasara.jpg" alt ="Fighting Game">
  <p>This game is definitely in my opinion a very underrated game. The game focuses
   on fighting within the Sengoku era of Japan, and it is a very unique hack and slash
   game that has many characters with different fighting styles. If you are looking
   for a unique hack and slash game that can grab your attention for awhile, this
   game is definitely for you.</p>
  <h3>3. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>
  <img src="media/skyrim.jpg" alt = "Open World Fantasy Adventure Game">
  <p>Skyrim is definitely one of my favorite open world RPGs. I can spend so much
  time on this game and spend hours and hours being immersed in the world, quests,
  and characters. The graphics of the game are spectacular, and I always buy this
  game when it comes out on a new system. If you haven't tried this game. I highly
  recommend checking it out if you have never heard of this game. I promise you
  won't regret it!</p>
  <h3>2. Harvest Moon Animal Parade</h3>
  <img src="media/harvestMoonAnimalParade.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator">
  <p>Harvest Moon Animal Parade is also another farming simulator that I enjoy. It
   is definitely a special game in my heart because it introduced me to farming
   simulation games, and I've definitely replayed this game a lot. I love it because
   like Stardew Valley, it's very relaxing, and I love the farming, characters, and
   the music of this game. The game isn't perfect, but I definitely have some wonderful
   memories from it making it my second favorite game. </p>
  <h3>1. Pokemon Heartgold</h3>
  <img src="media/heartGold.jpg" alt="Pocket Monsters RPG">
  <p>This game is my number one mainly due to personal reasons and nostalgia. It's
  the first video game I ever played, and it's what introduced me to video games as
  a whole and one of my favorite series which is Pokemon. I love this game to pieces
  from the battling system, the pokemon walking, and many other things. In my opinion,
  this is definitely one of the best pokemon games, and I think it definitely deserves
  to be given a chance if you've never played it and enjoy pokemon. </p>
